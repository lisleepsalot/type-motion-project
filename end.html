        Well Mr. Jones took a terrible fall<br>
        He had built the stairs but he hadn't counted them all<br>
        And the lights and the pain said it would rain<br>
        He said it would snow<br>
        He always said that, wherever he would go<br>
        And he would write down his thoughts on the wall<br>
        <br>
        Something about the power of it all<br>
        Call if you care for me at all<br>
        I've been surrounded by this loneliness<br>
        And if I could I would do it all over again<br>
        And I would be calm and wait for you<br>
        To show me all the things that no one else can do<br>
        Now what you need, what you got, what you want from me<br>
        I've got the wild inside to conquer and then I'll be free<br>
        <br>
        If I was free, if I was free<br>
        I would fly in between the moons of consciousness<br>
        And ride on the back of a shooting star<br>
        And float into your arms<br>

        And when he woke up, he went outside and changed the light bulb<br>
        Figured out that life was worth living when you could see<br>
        The doctor said they'd counseled him before and his tired mind of war<br>
        <br>
        But he was at war with himself and he lost it all<br>
        He was at home now feeling the power of the crumbling wall<br>
        <br>
        Oh, if I was free<br>
        I'd fly in between the moons of indolence<br>
        And I'd ride on the back of a shooting star<br>
        And float into your arms<br>
        If I was free<br>
        I'd let go of all the weight that's dragging me<br>
        And never again and never again<br>
        I put it all down and never again and never again<br>
        <br>
        Free, and I was free<br>
        I didn't even know that I'd been captured<br>
        But I remember the call, I remember the call<br>
        I remember when your voice came through the wall<br>
        And I was there and I was scared<br>
        I didn't even know that you were listening<br>
        And all those times I was shaking my head<br>
        From all the things I'd said<br><br><br><br><br>
